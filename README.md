*Recommendations*

1.Product Line Optimisation: Consider removing The 1985 Toyota Supra that has never been ordered for the past year, 
this could free up space in warehouse b.

2.Increase Budget for Promotional Campaigns to reduce the number of  overstocked products in the warehouses.
ex.Offering discounts,Bundle Deals etc.

3.Close Warehouse C & redistribute that inventory to Warehouse B since they are having a similar product line category and
the removal of 1985 Toyota Supra model could allow all the inventory of Warehouse C to be accomodated into warehouse B.
